# Unity AI: Patrolling, Chasing & Attacking

This Unity project demonstrates a simple enemy AI system with patrolling, chasing, and attacking behaviors, alongside a basic player movement and camera control setup.

---

## Project Overview

The enemy AI uses Unityâ€™s `NavMeshAgent` to patrol randomly within a defined area, detect the player within sight range, chase the player, and attack by shooting projectiles when in close range. The player can move freely using WASD controls, jump, and look around using the mouse.

---

## Features

- **Enemy AI States:** Patrol â†’ Chase â†’ Attack
- **Player Movement:** WASD movement, jumping, gravity
- **Mouse Look:** First-person camera control with clamped vertical rotation
- **Projectile Attack:** Enemy fires projectiles with cooldown

---

## Scripts Overview

### 1. AI_Scripts.cs

This script manages enemy behavior using a finite state approach:

- **Patrolling:** Randomly moves to walkpoints within a set range on the ground.
- **Chasing:** Pursues the player when detected within sight range.
- **Attacking:** Stops moving and fires a projectile when the player is within attack range.
- **Detection:** Uses sphere checks to detect player presence.
- **Attack Cooldown:** Prevents continuous firing by adding delay between attacks.
- **Visual Debug:** Gizmos show sight and attack ranges in the editor.

### 2. PlayerMovement.cs

This script controls the playerâ€™s movement and camera:

- **Movement:** Uses `CharacterController` for smooth movement with gravity.
- **Jumping:** Allows jumping only when grounded.
- **Ground Check:** Checks for ground using a sphere collider to prevent jumping in mid-air.
- **Mouse Look:** Rotates the player body horizontally and the camera vertically with clamping.
- **Cursor Lock:** Locks and hides the cursor for better control.

---

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Scene:**

   - Ensure your player GameObject is named `"Player"`.
   - Attach `NavMeshAgent` to your enemy GameObject.
   - Bake a NavMesh on your ground so enemies can navigate.
   - Assign appropriate layers for ground and player to `whatISGround` and `whatisPlayer`.

2. **Assign Scripts:**

   - Attach `AI_Scripts.cs` to your enemy GameObject.
   - Attach `PlayerMovement.cs` to your player GameObject.
   - Assign the necessary references in the Inspector (e.g., `groundCheck`, `playerBody`, `projectile` prefab).

3. **Projectile Setup:**

   - Create a projectile prefab with a Rigidbody component.
   - Assign the prefab to the `projectile` field in the enemyâ€™s `AI_Scripts` component.

4. **Play:**

   - Press play and control the player using WASD and mouse.
   - Observe the enemy patrolling, chasing, and attacking based on your movement.

Notes
Make sure to adjust NavMesh, layers, and prefab references before running the game.

Tweak variables like speeds, ranges, and cooldowns in the inspector for desired gameplay.

You can extend the AI by adding more states like Fleeing, Searching, or Idle behaviors.
